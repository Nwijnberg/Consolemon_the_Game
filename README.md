## Adding Consolemon to the Game
Adding new Consolemon to the game has been made generally modular and easy.    
Below, we will explain the steps to add a Consolemon to your local game system for the Windows, macOS en Linux ([Linux subsystems]) operating systems.

To add a Consolemon to the game permanently, please contact the developer of the game through the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Nwijnberg/Consolemon_the_Game).    
I will take your addition into consideration and add it if I feel the vibes are right!  
You will get credited at the startup of the game!

### Locally

To locally add your own Consolemon to the game, follow these steps for each OS.

#### Windows
To add a Consolemon to your local installation of the game, follow these steps.

1. Go to the "Program Files" folder by one of these ways:
   1. Open the Windows Run function by pressing Windows + R *or* open the search bar and type in "%ProgramFiles%".
   2. Open the File Explorer, go to "My PC", go to your main drive and open the "Program Files" folder.
2. Search for and open the "Consolemon" folder.
3. In the "consolemon-list" file, add your own Consolemon at the bottom under the "# Custom Consolemon" tag.
4. In the "Sprites" folder, add a new text file with the name of your Consolemon species and paste the sprite you want to use.

### Permanent addition to the Game
So you want to add your own Consolemon to the game.     
Luckily for you, I love modding and would be honored you want to add to this little project of mine.    
So, what to do.
Preferably, you use [GitHub's fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) functionality to send me your added Consolemon.
Alternatively, you can send me a message on GitHub, though I can't promise I'll respond quickly.
